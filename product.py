        - The most popular item to order is water (spring, boottled, artesian and distilled) while the least popular item is package AC.
        - The majority of the customers are from the USA; UK and Germany are the next most popular countries, and the smallest groups of customers are from Australia and Canada. 
        - There are almost twice as many men as women making transactions.
        - Most transactions correspond to the middle-income customers, whereas low income-customers are the second group and high income-customers tend to  make less transactions.
        - The biggest group of customers represents the regular customer segment, almost half of the customers belong to a new segment, whereas the premium segment is the smallest group.
        - There are five categories, being the two most popular electronics and grocery; clothing, books and home decor are equally in demand.
        - Pepsi is the most common product brand, the rest of the brands are equally in demand with the least demanded brands such as: Whirepool, Mitsubhisi and BlueStar.
        - Most of the customers are satisfied with a product or service, however, there are some that left a negative feedback.
        - There is no big difference in the shipping methods, being "same-day" and "express" shipping slightly more popular than the "standard" method.
        - People use more credit cards than debit.
        - Orders are mainly delivered, however, there are some of them with the status shipped, processing or pending, that likely depends on the date of order.

        **Correlation analysis displays**:

        - There is a negative relationship between **Country and Customer Age** as well as between **Country and Income**, thus, in certain countries customers are more likely to have a high income than in other countries, the same with the Age, customers of one country tend to be younger than customers of others. 
        - We can observe a positive relationship between **Age and Customer Segment**, which makes a lot of sense, the older the customer the higher the probability that he/she belongs to the premium segment.
        - There is a negative relationship between **Age and Feedback**, and positive relationship between Age and Ratings, thus, older customers tend to leave more positive feedback and give higher ratings.
        - **Customer Segment with Ratings** have a positive relationship: newly arrived customers are likely to receive better service, as a marketing ploy to attract customers and convert them into their clients, as a result, they are more satisfied giving better ratings. Here also can be included **Order Status** for different customer segments.
        - **Product Brand correlates with Feedback, Order Status and Ratings** in a positive way. Famous and recognised brands, such as Apple, Adidas, etc. have good reputation with mostly positive feedback and high ratings. Moreover, they try to deliver the best customer service (f.e. on-time delivery). 
        - There is a negative relationship between **Feedback and Ratings**, thus, the higher the ratings the more positive feedback the product receives.

           The goal is to recommend products that are similar to those the user has viewed or purchased previously.

           **Possible disadvantages**:
           The limitation of relying on a rating system is that products without user ratings won't be able to give a whole picture. 
           Therefore, you would have to force recommendations through push surveys or add some fictitious ratings to an unrated product in the system. 
           Another drawback is that this type of algorithm tends to form groups of similar users who, over time, will receive the same recommendations, 
           meaning the suggested products will become less personalized over time.
