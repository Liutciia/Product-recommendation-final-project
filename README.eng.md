##🌟 **Introduction**
Welcome to the Product Recommendation project! This project aims to build a recommendation engine using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest products to users based on their preferences and historical data.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information on user purchases, ratings, and product details. The dataset contains the following features:

User_ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Product_ID: Unique identifier for each product.
Purchase_History: A list of products previously purchased by the user.
Ratings: User ratings for the products.
Product_Category: The category to which the product belongs.
Product_Brand: The brand of the product.
🛠 Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: Remove missing values and outliers.
Normalization: Normalize numerical features to a standard scale.
Encoding: Convert categorical features to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Model Training
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for the KNN model.
Splitting Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Use GridSearchCV to find the optimal value of k (number of neighbors).
Training: Train the KNN model on the training data.
📈 Evaluation
The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct recommendations.
Precision: The ratio of relevant recommendations to the total recommendations made.
Recall: The ratio of relevant recommendations to the total relevant items.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
🏆 Results
The KNN model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: 0.98
Precision: 0.97
Recall: 0.96
F1-Score: 0.965
These results indicate that the KNN model is highly effective in recommending relevant products to users.
